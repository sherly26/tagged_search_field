# tagged_search_field
This is my way to build a Tagged Search Field that display a list with suggestions while the user type.

A regular search field at first, but once you start typing it starts filtering what you typing with the list (list's name is: 'all') that you provided. 
When the user is searching for something, it displays a list of matching results. 
Once the user selects a result, it adds a tag inside the field, which you can delete. 

And in case you select too many tags, the tag section inside the field has a horizontal scroll to allow the user see all the tags that area selected. 
Also when tag name is too long the tag name is shrinked.
